                <p>Fourth movie from the "Harry Potter" series. Honestly, not the best one but I've rewatched it recently and the music always makes this movie magical for me.</p>
        <h3>Captain America: The First Avenger</h3>
            <h4>Story: 7/10</h4>
            <h4>Visuals: 7/10</h4>

            <h4>Characters: 5/10</h4>   
                <p>Only a few interesting characters with the best one being the main character, Steve Rogers. The first Captain America movie and honestly it's a great introduction to that character and it makes for a decent movie overall.</p>
